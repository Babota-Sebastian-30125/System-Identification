The objective of this project was to develop a mathematical model that accurately describes the behaviour of a physical system based on experimental data. Parametric identification methods were used to precisely estimate the systemâ€™s parameters by analyzing its frequency response. This study enabled a detailed characterization of the system and provided a solid foundation for its modelling and optimization in practical applications.
